- Balanced Search Tree
- Priority Queue
- Heap
- String
- Graph (adjacency matrices/lists)

_* denotes a C pointer_

Dictionary Operation | Unsorted Array | Sorted Array

Search(L, k) | O(n) | O(logn)
Insert(L, * x) | O(1) | O(n)
Delete(L, * x) | O(1)$ | O(n)

Predecessor(L, * x) | O(n) | O(1)
Min(L) | O(n) | O(1)
Max(L) | O(n) | O(1)

_$ Deletion can be quickened by filling in the hole with A[n] and decrement n_

### Sample String Hash

Simple pattern searching of string _S_ with pattern _p_, naÃ¯ve looping gives **O(mn)** where _m=|p| n=|S|_. With hashing the expected case
can be reduced down to **O(m+n)**.
- Î±: size of the alphabet
- S: string
- m: size of hash table, ideally a large prime not too close to 2^i - 1
- ![String Hash Equation][str_hash]
- key: H(S) % m
The key is that finding the next window of _m_ characters can be calculated using:
![String Hash j plus one][str_hash_plus_one]

### Heap

Maintains a partial order on the set of elements which is weaker than the sorted order (efficient to maintain), yet stronger than random order(easier to find min).

**Max Heap** the parent has a key _>=_ than its children.

**Min Heap** the parent has a key _<=_ than its children.

Insertion takes at most O(logn) as the height is ![lg n][lg_n], thus creation of a heap takes at most ![n lg n][n_lg_n].

Heap construction time can be increased to linear by using _bubble down_ insertion, as only _n/2_ leafs travel all of ![lg n][lg_n], _n/4_ at height _1_, _n/8_ at height _2_ and so on. The cost becomes:

![Heap Bubble Down][heap_bubble_d]

**A Heap is not a Binary Tree**

### Sort
- Heap Sort ![n log n][n_lg_n]
- Merge Sort ![n log n][n_lg_n]
- Quick Sort (worst case n^2, _random_ case ![n log n][n_lg_n] with high probability)

### Graphs
- undirected / directed
- unweighted / weighted
- simple / non-simple (loop, dupe edge)
- sparse / dense
- cyclic / acyclic
- embedded / topological
- explicit / implicit
- unlabelled / labelled

### Graph Data Structures
**Adjacency Matrix**, rapid membership lookup, may use excessive space.

**Adjacency List**, linked list, slower lookup, less space.

DFS | BFS
--- | ---
Stack | Queue

- BFS: good for finding shortest path to a vertex (unweighted graph), or test graph validity such as bipartite graphs
- DFS: can use recursion rather than an explicit stack, has backtracking, easily find cycles from tree edges and back edges

- [Topological Sorting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_sorting), DFS on Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) for scheduling sequence of tasks with dependencies
- [Strongly Connected Components](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strongly_connected_component), DFS on directed graphs to find pockets of vertices that can reach each other

**Minimum Spanning Tree**, shortest cost to connect all vertices (roads, telephone wires, etc).
- [Prim's Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prim%27s_algorithm), from an arbitrary vertex, find cheapest neighbour.
- [Kruskal's Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kruskal's_algorithm), find cheapest edges as long as they don't form a cycle.
